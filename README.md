# 🧪 A/B Testing Simulation

This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and evaluation of A/B tests using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

## 🧠 Features

- Sample size estimation
- Power analysis
- Frequentist vs. Bayesian comparison
- Simulation of A/B test outcomes
- Visualization of conversion rates, posteriors, and errors

## 📁 Structure

- `data/`: Synthetic or real A/B test data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for simulations and analysis
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for power analysis and stats
- `images/`: Visuals used in the README or outputs
- `results/`: Output data from simulations

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
