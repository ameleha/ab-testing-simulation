# 🧪 A/B Testing Simulation

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of designing, simulating, and analyzing A/B tests using real-world-style data and statistical methods.

## 🧠 Features

- Descriptive statistics and visual exploration of A/B test metrics
- Statistical testing using appropriate methods:
  - T-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Z-tests, Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis
- Normality checks using Shapiro-Wilk and visualizations (histograms, Q-Q plots)
- Device-type-specific analysis (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Clear interpretation of results and statistical significance
- Summary tables highlighting results and group performance

## 📁 Structure

- `data/`: Synthetic A/B test data
- `notebooks/`: Step-by-step analysis notebooks
- `scripts/`: Data generation scripts
- `images/`: Plots and charts for documentation

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Launch the notebook (in Gitpod or locally):
jupyter notebook
